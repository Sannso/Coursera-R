	------------------ Principles of experimental design ------------------------------
There are a lot of concepts and terms inherent to experimental design. Letâ€™s go over some of these now!

Independent variable (AKA factor): The variable that the experimenter manipulates; it does not depend on other variables being measured. Often displayed on the x-axis.

Dependent variable: The variable that is expected to change as a result of changes in the independent variable. Often displayed on the y-axis, so that changes in X, the independent variable, effect changes in Y.

So when you are designing an experiment, you have to decide what variables you will measure, and which you will manipulate to effect changes in other measured variables. Additionally, you must develop your hypothesis, essentially an educated guess as to the relationship between your variables and the outcome of your experiment.
